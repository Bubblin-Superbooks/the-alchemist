<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Nab,
Has brought you another piece of gold to look on:
—We must appease him. Give it me,—and prays you,
You would devise—what is it, Nab?</p><p>DRUG. A sign, sir.</p><p>FACE. Ay, a good lucky one, a thriving sign, doctor.</p><p>SUB. I was devising now.</p><p>FACE. 'Slight, do not say so,
He will repent he gave you any more—
What say you to his constellation, doctor,
The Balance?</p><p>SUB. No, that way is stale, and common.
A townsman born in Taurus, gives the bull,
Or the bull's-head: in Aries, the ram,
A poor device! No, I will have his name
Form'd in some mystic character; whose radii,
Striking the senses of the passers by,
Shall, by a virtual influence, breed affections,
That may result upon the party owns it:
As thus—</p><p>FACE. Nab!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">SUB. He shall have "a bell," that's "Abel;"
And by it</p></div> </div>
