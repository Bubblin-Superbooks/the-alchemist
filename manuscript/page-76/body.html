Your master's worship's house here in the Friars,
For the vacations—</p><p>FACE. Will you be so loud?</p><p>SUB. Since, by my means, translated suburb-captain.</p><p>FACE. By your means, doctor dog!</p><p>SUB. Within man's memory,
All this I speak of.</p><p>FACE. Why, I pray you, have I
Been countenanced by you, or you by me?
Do but collect, sir, where I met you first.</p><p>SUB. I do not hear well.</p><p>FACE. Not of this, I think it.
But I shall put you in mind, sir;—at Pie-corner,
Taking your meal of steam in, from cooks' stalls,
Where, like the father of hunger, you did walk
Piteously costive, with your pinch'd-horn-nose,
And your complexion of the Roman wash,
Stuck full of black and melancholic worms,
Like powder corns shot at the artillery-yard.</p><p>SUB. I wish you could advance your voice a little.</p></div> </div>
