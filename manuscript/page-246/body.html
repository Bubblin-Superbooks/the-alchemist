[ASIDE TO DRUG.]
He owes this honest Drugger here, seven pound,
He has had on him, in two-penny'orths of tobacco.</p><p>DRUG. Yes, sir.
And he has damn'd himself three terms to pay me.</p><p>FACE. And what does he owe for lotium?</p><p>DRUG. Thirty shillings, sir;
And for six syringes.</p><p>SUR. Hydra of villainy!</p><p>FACE. Nay, sir, you must quarrel him out o' the house.</p><p>KAS. I will:
—Sir, if you get not out of doors, you lie;
And you are a pimp.</p><p>SUR. Why, this is madness, sir,
Not valour in you; I must laugh at this.</p><p>KAS. It is my humour: you are a pimp and a trig,
And an Amadis de Gaul, or a Don Quixote.</p><p>DRUG. Or a knight o' the curious coxcomb, do you see?</p></div> </div>
