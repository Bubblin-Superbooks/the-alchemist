Unladed now: you'll make six millions of them.â€”

And then we have finish'd. We must now increase
Our fire to ignis ardens; we are past

And all those lenter heats. If the holy purse
Should with this draught fall low, and that the saints

And with a tincture make you as good Dutch dollars
As any are in Holland.</p><p>TRI. Can you so?</p><p>SUB. Ay, and shall 'bide the third examination.</p><p>ANA. It will be joyful tidings to the brethren.</p><p>SUB. But you must carry it secret.</p></div> </div>
