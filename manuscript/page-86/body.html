â€”pray heaven,
The master do not trouble us this quarter.</p><p>FACE. O, fear not him. While there dies one a week
O' the plague, he's safe, from thinking toward London.
Beside, he's busy at his hop-yards now;
I had a letter from him. If he do,
He'll send such word, for airing of the house,
As you shall have sufficient time to quit it:
Though we break up a fortnight, 'tis no matter.</p><p>[RE-ENTER DOL.]</p><p>SUB. Who is it, Dol?</p><p>DOL. A fine young quodling.</p><p>FACE. O,
My lawyer's clerk, I lighted on last night,
In Holborn, at the Dagger. He would have
(I told you of him) a familiar,
To rifle with at horses, and win cups.</p><p>DOL. O, let him in.</p></div> </div>
