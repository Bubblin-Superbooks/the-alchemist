[EXIT ABEL.]
Subtle and I
Must wrestle for her.
[ASIDE.]
—Come on, master Dapper,
You see how I turn clients here away,
To give your cause dispatch; have you perform'd
The ceremonies were enjoin'd you?</p><p>DAP. Yes, of the vinegar,
And the clean shirt.</p><p>FACE. 'Tis well: that shirt may do you
More worship than you think. Your aunt's a-fire,
But that she will not shew it, t' have a sight of you.
Have you provided for her grace's servants?</p><p>DAP. Yes, here are six score Edward shillings.</p><p>FACE. Good!</p><p>DAP. And an old Harry's sovereign.</p><p>FACE. Very good!</p><p>DAP. And three James shillings, and an Elizabeth groat,
Just twenty nobles.</p><p>FACE. O, you are too just.
I would you had had the other noble in Maries.</p></div> </div>
