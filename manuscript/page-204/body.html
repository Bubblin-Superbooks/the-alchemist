The envy of princes and the fear of states.</p><p>DOL. Say you so, sir Epicure?</p><p>MAM. Yes, and thou shalt prove it,
Daughter of honour. I have cast mine eye
Upon thy form, and I will rear this beauty
Above all styles.</p><p>DOL. You mean no treason, sir?</p><p>MAM. No, I will take away that jealousy.
I am the lord of the philosopher's stone,
And thou the lady.</p><p>DOL. How, sir! have you that?</p><p>MAM. I am the master of the mystery.
This day the good old wretch here o' the house
Has made it for us: now he's at projection.
Think therefore thy first wish now, let me hear it;
And it shall rain into thy lap, no shower,
But floods of gold, whole cataracts, a deluge,
To get a nation on thee.</p></div> </div>
