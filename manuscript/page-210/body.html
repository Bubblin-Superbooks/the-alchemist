Your predicaments, substance, and accident,

The angry tongue he talks in?</p><p>SUB. That false precept,
Of being afore-hand, has deceived a number,
And made them enter quarrels, often-times,
Before they were aware; and afterward,
Against their wills.</p><p>KAS. How must I do then, sir?</p><p>SUB. I cry this lady mercy: she should first
Have been saluted.

Because you are to be one, ere't be long,
My soft and buxom widow.</p><p>KAS. Is she, i'faith?</p><p>SUB. Yes, or my art is an egregious liar.</p><p>KAS. How know you?</p></div> </div>
