Some three weeks since, I heard a doleful cry,
As I sat up a mending my wife's stockings.</p><p>LOVE. 'Tis strange that none will answer! Didst thou hear
A cry, sayst thou?</p><p>6 NEI. Yes, sir, like unto a man
That had been strangled an hour, and could not speak.</p><p>2 NEI. I heard it too, just this day three weeks, at two o'clock
Next morning.</p><p>LOVE. These be miracles, or you make them so!
A man an hour strangled, and could not speak,
And both you heard him cry?</p><p>3 NEI. Yes, downward, sir.</p><p>Love, Thou art a wise fellow. Give me thy hand, I pray thee.
What trade art thou on?</p><p>3 NEI. A smith, an't please your worship.</p></div> </div>
