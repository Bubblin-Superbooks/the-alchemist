By virtue of my staff.</p><p>ANA. They are the vessels
Of pride, lust, and the cart.</p><p>LOVE. Good zeal, lie still
A little while.</p><p>TRI. Peace, deacon Ananias.</p><p>LOVE. The house is mine here, and the doors are open;
If there be any such persons as you seek for,
Use your authority, search on o' God's name.
I am but newly come to town, and finding
This tumult 'bout my door, to tell you true,
It somewhat mazed me; till my man, here, fearing
My more displeasure, told me he had done
Somewhat an insolent part, let out my house
(Belike, presuming on my known aversion
From any air o' the town while there was sickness,)
To a doctor and a captain: who, what they are
Or where they be, he knows not.</p><p>MAM. Are they gone?</p></div> </div>
