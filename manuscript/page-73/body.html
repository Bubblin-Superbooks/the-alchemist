And in their working gain and profit meet,
He hopes to find no spirit so much diseased,
But will with such fair correctives be pleased:

They shall find things, they'd think or wish were done;
They are so natural follies, but so shewn,
As even the doers may see, and yet not own.</code></pre></div> </div>
