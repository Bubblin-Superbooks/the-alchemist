This is the gentleman, and he is no chiaus.</p><p>SUB. Captain, I have return'd you all my answer.
I would do much, sir, for your love—But this
I neither may, nor can.</p><p>FACE. Tut, do not say so.
You deal now with a noble fellow, doctor,
One that will thank you richly; and he is no chiaus:
Let that, sir, move you.</p><p>SUB. Pray you, forbear—</p><p>FACE. He has
Four angels here.</p><p>SUB. You do me wrong, good sir.</p><p>FACE. Doctor, wherein? to tempt you with these spirits?</p><p>SUB. To tempt my art and love, sir, to my peril.
Fore heaven, I scarce can think you are my friend,
That so would draw me to apparent danger.</p><p>FACE. I draw you! a horse draw you, and a halter,
You, and your flies together—</p></div> </div>
