<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">rascal,
This peremptory Face.</p><p>DOL. Content, I'm weary of him.</p><p>SUB. Thou'st cause, when the slave will run a wiving, Dol,
Against the instrument that was drawn between us.</p><p>DOL. I'll pluck his bird as bare as I can.</p><p>SUB. Yes, tell her,
She must by any means address some present
To the cunning man, make him amends for wronging
His art with her suspicion; send a ring,
Or chain of pearl; she will be tortured else
Extremely in her sleep, say, and have strange things
Come to her. Wilt thou?</p><p>DOL. Yes.</p><p>SUB. My fine flitter-mouse,
My bird o' the night! we'll tickle it at the Pigeons,
When we have all, and may unlock the trunks,
And say, this's mine, and thine; and thine, and mine.</p><p>[THEY KISS.]</p></div> </div>
