And kind spectators, if I have outstript
An old man's gravity, or strict canon, think

Yet 'twas decorum. And though I am clean
Got off from Subtle, Surly, Mammon, Dol,
Hot Ananias, Dapper, Drugger, all
With whom I traded: yet I put my self
On you, that are my country: and this pelf
Which I have got, if you do quit me, rests
To feast you often, and invite new guests."</p><p>[EXEUNT.]</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
