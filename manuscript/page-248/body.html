Thou art not of the light: That ruff of pride
About thy neck, betrays thee; and is the same
With that which the unclean birds, in seventy-seven,
Were seen to prank it with on divers coasts:
Thou look'st like antichrist, in that lewd hat.</p><p>SUR. I must give way.</p><p>KAS. Be gone, sir.</p><p>SUR. But I'll take
A course with you—</p><p>ANA. Depart, proud Spanish fiend!</p><p>SUR. Captain and doctor.</p><p>ANA. Child of perdition!</p><p>KAS. Hence, sir!—
[EXIT SURLY.]
Did I not quarrel bravely?</p><p>FACE. Yes, indeed, sir.</p><p>KAS. Nay, an I give my mind to't, I shall do't.</p><p>FACE. O, you must follow, sir, and threaten him tame:
He'll turn again else.</p><p>KAS. I'll re-turn him then.</p></div> </div>
