<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>LOVE. What device should he bring forth now?
I love a teeming wit as I love my nourishment:
'Pray God he have not kept such open house,
That he hath sold my hangings, and my bedding!
I left him nothing else. If he have eat them,
A plague o' the moth, say I! Sure he has got
Some bawdy pictures to call all this ging!
The friar and the nun; or the new motion
Of the knight's courser covering the parson's mare;
Or 't may be, he has the fleas that run at tilt
Upon a table, or some dog to dance.
When saw you him?</p><p>1 NEI. Who, sir, Jeremy?</p><p>2 NEI. Jeremy butler?
We saw him not this month.</p><p>LOVE. How!</p><p>4 NEI. Not these five weeks, sir.</p><p>6 NEI. These six weeks at the least.</p><p>LOVE. You amaze me, neighbours!</p><p>5 NEI. Sure, if your worship know not where he is,
He's slipt away.</p></div> </div>
