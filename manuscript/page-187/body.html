With sodden ale, and pellitory of the wall;
Cost me but two-pence. I had another sickness
Was worse than that.</p><p>FACE. Ay, that was with the grief
Thou took'st for being cess'd at eighteen-pence,
For the water-work.</p><p>DRUG. In truth, and it was like
T' have cost me almost my life.</p><p>FACE. Thy hair went off?</p><p>DRUG. Yes, sir; 'twas done for spight.</p><p>FACE. Nay, so says the doctor.</p><p>KAS. Pray thee, tobacco-boy, go fetch my suster;
I'll see this learned boy before I go;
And so shall she.</p><p>FACE. Sir, he is busy now:
But if you have a sister to fetch hither,
Perhaps your own pains may command her sooner;
And he by that time will be free.</p><p>KAS. I go.</p><p>[EXIT.]</p></div> </div>
