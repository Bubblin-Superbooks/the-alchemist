And then did nothing. What an oversight,
And want of putting forward, sir, was this!
Well fare an old harquebuzier, yet,
Could prime his powder, and give fire, and hit,
All in a twinkling!</p><p>[RE-ENTER MAMMON.]</p><p>MAM. The whole nest are fled!</p><p>LOVE. What sort of birds were they?</p><p>MAM. A kind of choughs,
Or thievish daws, sir, that have pick'd my purse
Of eight score and ten pounds within these five weeks,
Beside my first materials; and my goods,
That lie in the cellar, which I am glad they have left,
I may have home yet.</p><p>LOVE. Think you so, sir?</p><p>MAM. Ay.</p><p>LOVE. By order of law, sir, but not otherwise.</p><p>MAM. Not mine own stuff!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">LOVE. Sir, I can take no knowledge
