[ENTER FACE, IN HIS UNIFORM.]
Here comes the captain.</p><p>FACE. How now! is his mouth down?</p><p>SUB. Ay, he has spoken!</p><p>FACE. A pox, I heard him, and you too.
—He's undone then.—
I have been fain to say, the house is haunted
With spirits, to keep churl back.</p><p>SUB. And hast thou done it?</p><p>FACE. Sure, for this night.</p><p>SUB. Why, then triumph and sing
Of Face so famous, the precious king
Of present wits.</p><p>FACE. Did you not hear the coil
About the door?</p><p>SUB. Yes, and I dwindled with it.</p><p>FACE. Show him his aunt, and let him be dispatch'd:
I'll send her to you.</p><p>[EXIT FACE.]</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">SUB. Well, sir, your aunt her grace
Will give you audience presently, on my suit,
And the captain's word</p></div> </div>
