"Much, nephew, shalt thou win, much shalt thou spend,
Much shalt thou give away, much shalt thou lend."</p><p>SUB [ASIDE]. Ay, much! indeed.—
Why do you not thank her grace?</p><p>DAP. I cannot speak for joy.</p><p>SUB. See, the kind wretch!
Your grace's kinsman right.</p><p>DOL. Give me the bird.
Here is your fly in a purse, about your neck, cousin;
Wear it, and feed it about this day sev'n-night,
On your right wrist—</p><p>SUB. Open a vein with a pin,
And let it suck but once a week; till then,
You must not look on't.</p><p>DOL. No: and kinsman,
Bear yourself worthy of the blood you come on.</p><p>SUB. Her grace would have you eat no more Woolsack pies,
Nor Dagger frumety.</p><p>DOL. Nor break his fast
In Heaven and Hell.</p></div> </div>
