What! in a dream?</p><p>SUR. Must I needs cheat myself,
With that same foolish vice of honesty!
Come, let us go and hearken out the rogues:
That Face I'll mark for mine, if e'er I meet him.</p><p>FACE. If I can hear of him, sir, I'll bring you word,
Unto your lodging; for in troth, they were strangers
To me, I thought them honest as my self, sir.</p><p>[EXEUNT MAM. AND SUR.]</p><p>[RE-ENTER ANANIAS AND TRIBULATION.]</p><p>TRI. 'Tis well, the saints shall not lose all yet. Go,
And get some cartsâ€”</p><p>LOVE. For what, my zealous friends?</p><p>ANA. To bear away the portion of the righteous
Out of this den of thieves.</p><p>LOVE. What is that portion?</p><p>ANA. The goods sometimes the orphan's, that the brethren
Bought with their silver pence.</p></div> </div>
