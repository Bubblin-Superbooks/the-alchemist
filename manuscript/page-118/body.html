Thou hast descry'd the flower, the sanguis agni?</p><p>FACE. Yes, sir.</p><p>MAM. Where's master?</p><p>FACE. At his prayers, sir, he;
Good man, he's doing his devotions
For the success.</p><p>MAM. Lungs, I will set a period
To all thy labours; thou shalt be the master
Of my seraglio.</p><p>FACE. Good, sir.</p><p>MAM. But do you hear?
I'll geld you, Lungs.</p><p>FACE. Yes, sir.</p><p>MAM. For I do mean
To have a list of wives and concubines,
Equal with Solomon, who had the stone
Alike with me; and I will make me a back
With the elixir, that shall be as tough
As Hercules, to encounter fifty a night.â€”
