So pleasant! she'll mount you up, like quicksilver,
Over the helm; and circulate like oil,
A very vegetal: discourse of state,
Of mathematics, bawdry, any thing—</p><p>MAM. Is she no way accessible? no means,
No trick to give a man a taste of her—wit—
Or so?</p><p>SUB [WITHIN]. Ulen!</p><p>FACE. I'll come to you again, sir.</p><p>[EXIT.]</p><p>MAM. Surly, I did not think one of your breeding
Would traduce personages of worth.</p><p>SUR. Sir Epicure,
Your friend to use; yet still loth to be gull'd:
I do not like your philosophical bawds.
Their stone is letchery enough to pay for,
Without this bait.</p><p>MAM. 'Heart, you abuse yourself.
I know the lady, and her friends, and means,
The original of this disaster. Her brother
Has told me all.</p><p>SUR. And yet you never saw her
Till now!</p></div> </div>
