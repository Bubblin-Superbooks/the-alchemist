My master's in the way. Please you to walk
Three or four turns, but till his back be turned,
And I am for you.—Quickly, Dol!</p><p>SUB. Her grace
Commends her kindly to you, master Dapper.</p><p>DAP. I long to see her grace.</p><p>SUB. She now is set
At dinner in her bed, and she has sent you
From her own private trencher, a dead mouse,
And a piece of gingerbread, to be merry withal,
And stay your stomach, lest you faint with fasting:
Yet if you could hold out till she saw you, she says,
It would be better for you.</p><p>FACE. Sir, he shall
Hold out, an 'twere this two hours, for her highness;
I can assure you that. We will not lose
All we have done.—</p><p>SUB. He must not see, nor speak
To any body, till then.</p><p>FACE. For that we'll put, sir,
A stay in's mouth.</p></div> </div>
