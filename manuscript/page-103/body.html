He will be of the clothing of his company,
And next spring call'd to the scarlet; spend what he can.</p><p>FACE. What, and so little beard?</p><p>SUB. Sir, you must think,
He may have a receipt to make hair come:
But he'll be wise, preserve his youth, and fine for't;
His fortune looks for him another way.</p><p>FACE. 'Slid, doctor, how canst thou know this so soon?
I am amused at that!</p><p>SUB. By a rule, captain,
In metoposcopy, which I do work by;
A certain star in the forehead, which you see not.
Your chestnut or your olive-colour'd face
Does never fail: and your long ear doth promise.
I knew't by certain spots, too, in his teeth,
And on the nail of his mercurial finger.</p></div> </div>
