One of the treacherousest memories, I do think,
Of all mankind.</p><p>SUR. What call you her brother?</p><p>MAM. My lord—
He will not have his name known, now I think on't.</p><p>SUR. A very treacherous memory!</p><p>MAM. On my faith—</p><p>SUR. Tut, if you have it not about you, pass it,
Till we meet next.</p><p>MAM. Nay, by this hand, 'tis true.
He's one I honour, and my noble friend;
And I respect his house.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">SUR. Heart! can it be,
That a grave sir, a rich, that has no need,
A wise sir, too, at other times, should thus,
With his own oaths, and arguments, make hard means
To gull himself? An this be your elixir,
Your lapis mineralis, and your lunary,
Give me your honest trick yet at primero,
Or gleek; and take your lutum</p></div> </div>
