The knight sir Mammon claims?</p><p>ANA. I do defy
The wicked Mammon, so do all the brethren,
Thou profane man! I ask thee with what conscience
Thou canst advance that idol against us,
That have the seal? were not the shillings number'd,
That made the pounds; were not the pounds told out,
Upon the second day of the fourth week,
In the eighth month, upon the table dormant,
The year of the last patience of the saints,
Six hundred and ten?</p><p>LOVE. Mine earnest vehement botcher,
And deacon also, I cannot dispute with you:
But if you get you not away the sooner,
I shall confute you with a cudgel.</p><p>ANA. Sir!</p><p>TRI. Be patient, Ananias.</p><p>ANA. I am strong,
And will stand up, well girt, against an host
That threaten Gad in exile.</p></div> </div>
