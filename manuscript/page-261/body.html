<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">weeks, as to a second Hogsden,
In days of Pimlico and Eye-bright.</p><p>FACE. Sir,
Their wisdoms will not say so.</p><p>LOVE. To-day they speak
Of coaches and gallants; one in a French hood
Went in, they tell me; and another was seen
In a velvet gown at the window: divers more
Pass in and out.</p><p>FACE. They did pass through the doors then,
Or walls, I assure their eye-sights, and their spectacles;
For here, sir, are the keys, and here have been,
In this my pocket, now above twenty days:
And for before, I kept the fort alone there.
But that 'tis yet not deep in the afternoon,
I should believe my neighbours had seen double
Through the black pot, and made these apparitions!
For, on my faith to your worship, for these three weeks
And upwards the door has not been open'd.</p><p>LOVE. Strange!</p><p>1 NEI. Good faith, I think I saw a coach.</p></div> </div>
