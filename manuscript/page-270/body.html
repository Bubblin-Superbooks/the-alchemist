<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">shall I do? I am catch'd.</p><p>LOVE. Good neighbours,
I thank you all. You may depart.
[EXEUNT NEIGHBOURS.]
—Come, sir,
You know that I am an indulgent master;
And therefore conceal nothing. What's your medicine,
To draw so many several sorts of wild fowl?</p><p>FACE. Sir, you were wont to affect mirth and wit—
But here's no place to talk on't in the street.
Give me but leave to make the best of my fortune,
And only pardon me the abuse of your house:
It's all I beg. I'll help you to a widow,
In recompence, that you shall give me thanks for,
Will make you seven years younger, and a rich one.
'Tis but your putting on a Spanish cloak:
I have her within. You need not fear the house;
It was not visited.</p><p>LOVE. But by me, who came
Sooner than you expected.</p><p>FACE. It is true, sir.
'Pray you forgive me.</p></div> </div>
