<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>SUB. O, you are sent from master Wholesome,
Your teacher?</p><p>ANA. From Tribulation Wholesome,
Our very zealous pastor.</p><p>SUB. Good! I have
Some orphans' goods to come here.</p><p>ANA. Of what kind, sir?</p><p>SUB. Pewter and brass, andirons and kitchen-ware,
Metals, that we must use our medicine on:
Wherein the brethren may have a pennyworth
For ready money.</p><p>ANA. Were the orphans' parents
Sincere professors?</p><p>SUB. Why do you ask?</p><p>ANA. Because
We then are to deal justly, and give, in truth,
Their utmost value.</p><p>SUB. 'Slid, you'd cozen else,
And if their parents were not of the faithful!â€”
I will not trust you, now I think on it,
'Till I have talked with your pastor. Have you brought money
To buy more coals?</p></div> </div>
