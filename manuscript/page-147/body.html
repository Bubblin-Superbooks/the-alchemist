Must not have entrance in the work.â€”Who are you?</p><p>ANA. A faithful brother, if it please you.</p><p>SUB. What's that?
A Lullianist? a Ripley? Filius artis?
Can you sublime and dulcify? calcine?
Know you the sapor pontic? sapor stiptic?
Or what is homogene, or heterogene?</p><p>ANA. I understand no heathen language, truly.</p><p>SUB. Heathen! you Knipper-doling? is Ars sacra,
Or chrysopoeia, or spagyrica,
Or the pamphysic, or panarchic knowledge,
A heathen language?</p><p>ANA. Heathen Greek, I take it.</p><p>SUB. How! heathen Greek?</p><p>ANA. All's heathen but the Hebrew.</p><p>SUB. Sirrah, my varlet, stand you forth and speak to him,
Like a philosopher: answer in the language.
Name the vexations, and the martyrisations
Of metals in the work.</p></div> </div>
