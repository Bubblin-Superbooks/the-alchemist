Sweet Madam, let me be particular—</p><p>DOL. Particular, sir! I pray you know your distance.</p><p>MAM. In no ill sense, sweet lady; but to ask
How your fair graces pass the hours? I see
You are lodged here, in the house of a rare man,
An excellent artist; but what's that to you?</p><p>DOL. Yes, sir; I study here the mathematics,
And distillation.</p><p>MAM. O, I cry your pardon.
He's a divine instructor! can extract
The souls of all things by his art; call all
The virtues, and the miracles of the sun,
Into a temperate furnace; teach dull nature
What her own forces are. A man, the emperor
Has courted above Kelly; sent his medals
And chains, to invite him.</p><p>DOL. Ay, and for his physic, sir—</p><p>MAM. Above the art of Aesculapius,
That drew the envy of the thunderer!
I know all this, and more.</p></div> </div>
